#summary Instructions for defining the context in which your CSS executes.

= Introduction =

The CSS context object is used to configure the CSS engine by defining 
the main object factory (`ICSSFactory`), CSS property definitions (`IPropertyManager`),
and object-CSS views (`ICSSView`). Every CSS instance requires a context object.

= Details =

`CSSContext` is the base implementation of `ICSSContext` and is the leanest configuration.

`CSS3Context` is an implementation of `ICSSContext` that contains the property and shorthand
managers specific to CSS3 (background, border, font, etc.).


The CSS context can be defined in one of two ways:

{{{

import com.newgonzo.web.css.*:

// set it once for all future CSS instances
CSS.defaultContext = new CSS3Context();
var mycss:CSS = new CSS("p {color: #F00;}");

// set it on a per-insace basis (or override the default)
var mycss:CSS = new CSS("p {color: #F00;}", new CSS3Context());

}}}
